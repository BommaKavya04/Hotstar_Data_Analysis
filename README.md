# Diversify Age-Rated Content: 
With U/A 13+ and U-rated content being the most common, there is potential to diversify content across other age ratings. Creating more PG and A-rated content could attract older audiences and expand the viewer base. 

# Increase Production of Top Genres: 
 The popularity trends show a consistent demand for Drama, Comedy, and Romance genres. Increasing the production and marketing of content in these genres can attract more audience base.

# Targeted Campaigns Based on Genre Popularity: 
Using insights from the popularity of genres over time, marketing campaigns can be tailored to promote the most popular genres. For instance, a campaign focused on the resurgence of Drama can attract long-time fans and new viewers. 
 
# Leverage Release Trends: 
 Since a significant number of releases occurred between 2010 and 2019, highlighting content from this period can evoke nostalgia and attract viewers who have fond memories of shows and movies from these years.
